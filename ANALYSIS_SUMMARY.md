## Methodology

### Antibody Trial Identification
The analysis uses multiple criteria to identify antibody therapeutic trials:
1. **Text-based Search**: Keywords like "antibody", "mab", "monoclonal"
2. **Known Drug Names**: Predefined list of approved antibody drugs
3. **Target-based**: Molecular targets commonly associated with antibodies

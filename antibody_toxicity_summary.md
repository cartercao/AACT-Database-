## Methodology
- Data Source: ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT database)
- Antibody Identification: Based on intervention keywords and biological classification
- Toxicity Analysis: Adverse events extraction and categorization by organ system
- Analysis Period: All available data in database

## Limitations
- Adverse events reporting may vary across trials
- Some trials may have incomplete safety data
- Classification based on keywords may miss some antibody therapeutics
- Sample data used for demonstration purposes

## Recommendations
1. Monitor gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities closely
2. Implement early detection for serious adverse events
3. Consider organ-specific monitoring protocols
4. Develop targeted toxicity management strategies
5. Focus on Phase 2 trials for safety monitoring
6. Establish protocols for managing cytokine release syndrome

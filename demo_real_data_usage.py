To use real AACT data, you have several options:

A. Download Full AACT Dataset (~1GB+):
   python3 download_aact_data.py
   # Choose option 1 for full dataset
   
B. Download Sample Dataset (for testing):
   python3 download_aact_data.py
   # Choose option 2 for sample dataset
   
C. Download Specific Tables:
   python3 download_aact_data.py
   # Choose option 3 and select specific tables
   
The downloader will create:
- aact_data/ directory
- CSV files for each table
- SQLite database (optional)

Once you have the AACT data, you can run the analysis:

A. Basic Analysis (with sample data):
   python3 simple_antibody_analysis.py
   
B. Full Analysis with Visualizations:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 antibody_toxicity_analysis.py
   
C. Advanced Analysis with Real Data:
   python3 advanced_antibody_analysis.py
   
The advanced analysis will:
- Load real AACT data from CSV/SQLite files
- Identify antibody therapeutic trials
- Analyze toxicity profiles by target and drug
- Generate comprehensive reports and visualizations

The following AACT tables are most relevant for antibody analysis:

1. studies - Clinical trial information
   - nct_id, official_title, brief_title
   - phase, enrollment, status
   - start_date, completion_date
   
2. interventions - Drug and treatment details
   - nct_id, intervention_type, intervention_name
   - description, arm_label
   
3. conditions - Disease/condition information
   - nct_id, condition, condition_type
   
4. adverse_events - Safety and toxicity data
   - nct_id, adverse_event_term
   - severity, frequency, serious
   
5. outcomes - Study outcomes and endpoints
   - nct_id, outcome_type, outcome_measure
   
6. sponsors - Trial sponsorship information
   - nct_id, sponsor_name, sponsor_type
   
7. facilities - Clinical trial sites
   - nct_id, facility_name, facility_type

The analysis uses multiple strategies to identify antibody trials:

1. Text-based Search:
   Keywords: antibody, mab, monoclonal, immunoglobulin
   Targets: CD20, HER2, PD-1, VEGF, TNF-alpha, etc.
   
2. Known Drug Names:
   Rituximab, Trastuzumab, Pembrolizumab, Bevacizumab
   Adalimumab, Tocilizumab, Cetuximab, etc.
   
3. Target-based Identification:
   Molecular targets commonly associated with antibodies
   
4. Intervention Type Filtering:
   Focus on "Drug" intervention types

The toxicity analysis includes:

1. Adverse Event Categorization:
   - Hepatotoxicity (liver injury)
   - Cardiotoxicity (cardiac dysfunction)
   - Neurotoxicity (neurological events)
   - Immunotoxicity (immune-related events)
   - Cytokine release syndrome
   - Infusion reactions
   
2. Severity Assessment:
   - Mild, Moderate, Severe, Life-threatening
   - Based on CTCAE criteria
   
3. Frequency Analysis:
   - Event rates by drug/target
   - Statistical significance testing
   
4. Risk Scoring:
   - Composite safety scores
   - Target-specific risk profiles

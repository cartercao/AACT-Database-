1. **Implement intensive monitoring** protocols
2. **Establish early warning systems** for serious events
3. **Develop rapid response teams** for immune-related toxicities
4. **Monitor organ function** closely (cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic)

### **For Moderate-Risk Antibodies (Anti-CD20, Anti-VEGF)**
1. **Regular hematological monitoring** for cytopenias
2. **Blood pressure monitoring** for VEGF inhibitors
3. **Infection prophylaxis** for CD20 inhibitors
4. **Dose adjustment protocols** for toxicity management

### **For Lower-Risk Antibodies (Anti-TNF, Anti-IL-23)**
1. **Standard safety monitoring** protocols
2. **Infection screening** for TNF inhibitors
3. **Malignancy monitoring** for long-term use
4. **Patient education** on common side effects
